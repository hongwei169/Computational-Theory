## Get Started
To facilitate easy access and interaction with the `countdown.ipynb` notebook, I have prepared a version that can be opened directly in Google Colab. Click the following button to launch the notebook:

It opens the  `countdown.ipynb` in [Google Colab]https://colab.research.google.com/).


## Project Overview

The `countdown.ipynb` notebook within this repository provides a detailed exploration of solving the Countdown numbers game using various computational methods, including Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and recursive search strategies. The project aims to demonstrate the application of these methods in a structured manner, highlighting their computational efficiency and practical implications in solving complex numerical puzzles.

## Features

- **Interactive Analysis**: The notebook includes interactive cells where different computational strategies are implemented and tested.
- **Visualization**: Graphical visualizations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms used.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Each part of the notebook includes detailed explanations that discuss the reasoning and theory behind each computational approach.

## Requirements

To run the notebook in Google Colab, no additional installations are required. However, if you choose to run the notebook locally, ensure that your Python environment meets the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Installation

To set up your local environment to run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hongwei169/Computational-Theory.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
    cd Computational-Theory
    ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```


## How to Use
To open and run the notebook:

- In Google Colab: Simply click the 'Open In Colab' button above.
- Locally: After installation, launch Jupyter Notebook in your environment and navigate to the countdown.ipynb file to open it.
