    "![Logo.png](images/Logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown numbers game is a fascinating and challenging mathematics-based game featured in the TV programme \"Countdown.\"\n",
    " \n",
    "The primary objective of the game is to reach a target number by using arithmetic operations on six randomly chosen numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a detailed breakdown of the game's rules and structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number Selection:\n",
    "- Each contestant receives six numbers, randomly selected from a set consisting of:\n",
    "  - **Small numbers**: Two sets of integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).\n",
    "  - **Large numbers**: One set of the numbers 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n",
    "- Each contestant selects six numbers from these sets, typically choosing a combination of large and small numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Number:\n",
    "- A random target number is generated, which the contestants must reach. This number ranges between 101 and 999 (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "![TargetNumber.png](images/TargetNumber.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of the Game\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations:\n",
    "- Contestants can use the four basic arithmetic operations to reach the target number:\n",
    "     - Addition  `+`\n",
    "     - Subtraction  `-`\n",
    "     - Multiplication  `*`\n",
    "     - Division  `/`\n",
    "- Each of the six chosen numbers can be used at most once in the calculation.\n",
    "- The operations can be used repeatedly and in any combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation Restrictions:\n",
    "- Only whole numbers can be generated during the calculations. This means:\n",
    "  - Division is only permissible if it results in a whole number.\n",
    "  - Subtraction can only be used if it results in a positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "- The primary goal is to use the six numbers and arithmetic operations to calculate the target number.\n",
    "- If the exact number cannot be reached, getting as close as possible to the target number is the next best outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring:\n",
    "- The exact scoring rules can vary, but typically:\n",
    "  - Exact solutions receive the highest score.\n",
    "  - Solutions within a range of the target number (e.g., within 5) might receive a partial score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game Strategy\n",
    "- Players must strategically select their numbers, considering the balance between large and small numbers to maximize their chances of reaching or getting close to the target number.\n",
    "- The game requires not just mathematical skill but also strategic foresight and sometimes a bit of luck in the number selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity\n",
    "- The game's complexity arises from the combinatorial nature of the number and operation selections. Players must navigate through a vast space of possible number combinations and operation sequences to reach the target number.\n",

    "# Deeper Analysis of Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational complexity of the Countdown numbers game is a multifaceted issue that encompasses the combinatorial explosion of number combinations and the permutations of operations. This section aims to provide a deeper understanding of these complexities and their implications on potential solution strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combinatorial Explosion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial set of numbers for the game includes up to two copies of integers from 1 to 10 and one copy each of 25, 50, 75, and 100, leading to a vast number of potential combinations. The combinatorial nature of selecting six numbers from this set already introduces complexity, especially when considering duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given \\(n\\) numbers where \\(n = 6\\), and allowing for repetition, the number of unique sets can be calculated using the formula for combinations with repetition: \\(\\binom{n + r - 1}{r}\\), where \\(r\\) is the size of the subset chosen. However, since numbers can be repeated and their order in operation matters, this only scratches the surface of the complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operation Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "For any solution attempt, there are four operations that can be applied: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The sequence in which these operations are applied to the selected numbers significantly increases the solution space. If we consider a simple case of applying operations to just two numbers, there are 4 possible operations. When applying operations sequentially across multiple numbers, the permutations grow exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Algorithmic Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute-force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A brute-force approach, attempting every possible combination of numbers and operations, faces a factorial growth in complexity. For six numbers, considering sequential operations without repetition, the complexity can be approximated as \\(O(n! \\cdot 4^n)\\), accounting for both the permutation of number order and the selection of operations. This is straightforward but computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Space Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing the search space is critical for a feasible solution. Techniques such as pruning (eliminating branches of the search tree that cannot possibly lead to the target number) and memoization (caching the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations) are vital.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristic approaches aim to intelligently reduce the number of combinations and operations considered by prioritizing those more likely to lead to the target number. These approaches make decisions that seem best at the moment. For example, choosing operations that bring the current result closest to the target number. Heuristics don't guarantee an optimal solution but can significantly reduce the search space and computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    " If a problem's solutions can be built from solutions to subproblems, dynamic programming might be a good approach. However, the unique constraints of the Countdown game (e.g., each number can only be used once) make dynamic programming less applicable here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking and Branch-and-Bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking involves systematically exploring the solution space and abandoning paths that do not lead to a solution. Branch-and-bound improves upon this by incorporating bounds to eliminate paths that cannot outperform the best solution found so far, thereby reducing the search space. This approach systematically explores each combination of numbers and operations but backs up (backtracks) when it's clear that the current path won't lead to a solution. It's more efficient than brute force because it eliminates many unnecessary calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown numbers game presents a rich problem space characterized by combinatorial explosion and exponential growth in operation permutations. Advanced algorithmic strategies, including dynamic programming, backtracking, and heuristic methods, are essential for developing efficient solutions. This deeper analysis underscores the complexity of the game and the sophistication required in algorithm design to tackle it effectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "After executing the function with the given set of numbers and the target of `945`, the algorithm's output is analyzed to determine the efficacy of the solution path it has discovered. The solution path provided gives us insight into the sequence of operations that the algorithm determined to be the most effective in approaching the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided plot offers a visual representation of how the algorithm progresses towards the target number with each recursive call made. The key observations from the plot are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertical Lines**: These represent significant changes in the total value, which are likely due to multiplication or division operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Horizontal Lines (Plateaus)**: These suggest periods during the recursion where operations performed do not alter the total value, indicating exploration of combinations that return to previously calculated totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale**: The wide range of total values on the vertical axis shows the algorithm exploring a diverse set of numerical combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Density of Steps**: The dense clustering of steps along the horizontal axis highlights the exhaustive nature of the search strategy employed by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot is indicative of the extensive search conducted by the algorithm in its quest to find the closest solution to the target number. The fluctuations and spikes in total value illustrate the exploratory nature of the algorithm\n",

    "## Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. This characteristic makes it very useful for computational operations, especially for computer-based calculations, because it aligns with stack-based, sequential data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using RPN in the Countdown Game:\n",
    "- **Simplifying Expression Evaluation**: RPN provides a clear sequence of operations without the need for parentheses, reducing complexity when programming a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural Fit for Stack-Based Evaluation**: Using stacks to evaluate RPN expressions aligns with how many algorithms, particularly those in computational theory, operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ease of Implementing Algorithms**: Recursive and iterative algorithms for solving the Countdown puzzle can be more simply implemented using RPN, as the next operation to perform is \n",

    "### Solving Countdown with RPN:\n",
    "To solve a Countdown puzzle using RPN, one could generate RPN expressions from the given numbers and operations that may lead to the target number. Here's a high-level approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Numbers and Operations**: Choose numbers from the set and decide which operations to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate RPN Expressions**: Form RPN expressions using the chosen numbers and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate the RPN Expression**: Use a stack to evaluate the RPN expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Against Target**: Compare the result of the expression with the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterate and Optimize**: Iterate over different combinations of numbers and operations, aiming to find an RPN expression that matches the target number or comes as close as possible."

    "Recursive search is a fundamental technique in computer science used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler, smaller subproblems of the same type. It's particularly effective for tasks where a problem can naturally be divided into cases with overlapping subproblems, such as searching, sorting, and navigating complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Recursive Search\n",
    "At its core, recursive search involves a function calling itself with a modified input until a base condition is met. This method is powerful because it simplifies complex problems into manageable parts, and each recursive call can build upon the results of previous ones.\n",

    "- **Simplicity**: Recursive functions are often easier to write and understand than their iterative counterparts, especially when the problem involves nested or hierarchical data structures.\n",
